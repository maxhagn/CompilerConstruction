# Compiler Construction

This repository contains my first self-written programming language, which I developed during the course compiler development at the Vienna University of Technology. The lexical analysis is based on the tool Flex. The parser was developed with the help of YACC. The described grammar was attributed with the assistance of OX. Finally, a tree grammar was created with the help of OX and iBurg, which can be used to generate Assembler 64 code.
